## Hey there! 👋

I'm Yehor, a Python web developer from Ukraine.

I design and build web apps using Flask and FastAPI.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll code it, test it, and deploy it the same evening.

My main tech stack is Python, Flask, FastAPI, and a bit of HTML/CSS/JS when I need clean UI. My favorite tools are VS Code, GitHub, and Render for quick deployments.
